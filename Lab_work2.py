# taking the first number from the user and converting it to an integer
num_one = int(input("Enter the first integer: "))

# Taking the second number from the user and converting it to an integer
num_two = int(input("Enter the second integer: "))

# Adding the two numbers and storing the result in sum_num
sum_num = num_one + num_two

# Printing the result
print("The sum is:", sum_num)
